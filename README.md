# brotli-cli

Brotli files compressor, now from 10 times faster! âš¡

## Usage

1. Install globally `npm i -g brotli-cli`
1. No install: `npx brotli-cli ... (other params)`

### Compressing given files:
1. `brotli-cli compress file1.txt file2.svg file3.js`

> Files will be created in the same directory, but with `.br` extension appended. Overwriting will occur without asking.

### Compressing by glob pattern:
1. `brotli-cli compress --glob "public/*.html"`

> Files will be created in the same directory, but with `.br` extension appended. Overwriting will occur without asking.

### Printing to stdout:
> To do this, you can only specify one file to compress, and you have to add `-` at the end of the command.
1. `brotli-cli compress index.html -`
1. `brotli-cli compress index.html - > compressed.html`

  brotli-cli compress --glob --bail false "images/*.jpg"   Compress all jpg files from `images` directory, do not stop on first error (will still print errors to stderr and exit with error code).
```

## Limitations and warnings

Because node's `zlib` can't work with streams (nor the previously used `brotli` npm module) -
all the file contents to be compressed must be loaded into memory.
Usually this does not matter, but keep few things in mind:
- if you're low on memory and you're compressing large files you might want to decrease threads amount
- compressing files over 1GB on 32-bit systems and 2GB on 64-bit systems is even less memory efficient
- absolute max file size limit is 4GB (actually it's determined by `buffer.constants.MAX_LENGTH` so this may vary)
